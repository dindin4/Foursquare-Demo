# Foursquare-Demo

Simple Demo Application that allows you to search for a place by name and return the recommended or popular venues near that current location using the FourSquare REST API. 

The approach taken was based on the assumption that users would search for places with the intention to visit and check them out. The app allows them to sort the results based on distance or overall rating depending on what they prefer. Each place will open up to a details screen which present them with the route from their current location presented on a map which they can then follow on their journey. If they wish to call and find out more, there is also a contact option.
